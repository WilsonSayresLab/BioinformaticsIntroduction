# Bioinformatics Introduction

Here we compile our best practices for introducing new trainees to computational biology.

This includes links to codes, trainings, and other useful computational resources.

## 1. Introduction to command line
For any work we will do as computational biologists it is exceedingly useful to understand that there is a way of interacting with data via the command line. 
Many students have found it useful to start with the tutorial:

Now that you've tried out the command line in a browser, let's see how it works on your computer. 

#### 1. Mac: Accessing the command line

If you have a Mac, you actually have two operating systems installed. You have the Mac operating system that you typically interact with, and you have a Unix operating system that you can interact with via the terminal. To find the terminal, you can go to Applications > Utilities and find the application called "Terminal.app". The pathname (remember our Command Line tutorial above) is: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app Double click on Terminal.app. You are now in the Unix terminal on your Mac machine. 

#### 2. Windows: Accessing Linux-like command line
If you are on a Windows machine, you can install Cygwin, a Linux-like environment that will allow you to run things very similar to a Unix/Linux system:

* go to http://cygwin.com/install.html
* click the setup-x84_64.exe link located under "Installing and Updating Cygwin for 64-bit versions of Windows"
* click the file at bottom of screen
* click next, choose Install from Internet, click next again
* the default Root Directory and Install For fields are fine
* the default Local Package Directory should be fine 
* choose Direct Connection in the next window

*This is where it becomes more involved.
* scroll down the list in the Available Download Sites until you find the one that says "http://mirrors.kernel.org" 
* Click what looks like the refresh symbol  next to Databases and GNOME. (to the right of the refresh symbol it should change from Default to Install)
* click next on the next window and it should start downloading 

This may take a while to download. About 20-30 minutes

#### 3. Unix/Linux Tutorials 
Now that you have access to the shell/terminal on your computer, you can run through additional tutorials. Students in the lab have found these tutorials useful:

		UNIX Tutorial for Beginners

## 2. Introduction to python
There are many different languages that we can write code or scripts in for analyzing our data. One of the most commonly used langauges in bioinfomatics is python. The tutorial at codecademy can help you get started with learning python syntax, though there are many other places to learn coding in python.

## 3. Introduction to R
Other than working within the terminal (command line), and writing codes in python, the other key component to doing bioinformatics is being able to do statistics. For our lab, nearly all the statistical analysis we do will be in R. R is a "free software environment for statistical computing and graphics": https://www.r-project.org. Similar to python, there are many tutorials for R, but one that many trainees in the lab have found useful is:
